Midterm Twitter Bot: Matchday Bot
API: API-Football (soccer)
	- has both paid and free subscription plans
	- free limits api requests to 100 per day

Description: The bot, at the start of each day, will post a list of popular football fixtures that will be 
played that day. For each match, the bot will also post relevant information pertaining the two teams involved. 
After all games have been played (tentative), the bot will post results (and potentially updated league table).

Motivation: My dad and his friends (and me) are quite the football fans. Due to quarantine, football games have 
become even more essential to them. Instead of him asking me what games are on today, why not have a bot tell 
him instead? I think the bot will also be useful to those that are busy with work and can't necessarily browse
their phones. The bot can just tell them info everyday without the need for them to actively browse the web.
